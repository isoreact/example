# IsoReact Example

This example demonstrates a small isomorphic React web app using
[IsoReact](https://github.com/isoreact/core). It features three isomorphic
elements (from two isomorphic components) being rendered server-side and
inserted into a Handlebars template. When the page loads in the browser, the
isomorphic React elements are hydrated.

You will need Node.js 10 and npm 6.

## Quick start

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
